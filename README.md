## ðŸ“Œ Archived Project Notice  

This project was created as part of a self-paced online bootcamp around 1â€“2 years ago. It includes a multi-page layout with navigation links and basic functionality. While the code works, it reflects my early development practices and includes references (such as social media links) tied to the original bootcamp material.  

Iâ€™ve archived it to keep my portfolio focused on more recent and polished work, but Iâ€™m leaving it hosted so the live demo remains accessible.

## Overview

This is a project that I completed using HTML, CSS, and Flexbox. For my HTML I utilized HTML boilerplate.

## My process

1. I began by initializing my project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/rtoddm/unplugged-retreat).
2. Then I configured my repository to publish my code to a web address (GitHub pages).
3. I looked through the designs in order to plan how I'd tackle the project. This step is important to help you think through potential CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. However, before worrying about any styles, I structured my HTML content.
5. I then wrote out the basic styles for my project such as `font-family` and `font-size`, etc.
6. Then I started adding CSS styles to the top of the page and worked down.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- HTML Boilerplate
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

One of the biggest things I learned from this project was structuring your HTML correctly and using semantic tags. I also practiced using HTML Boilerplate instead of creating the entire file from scratch.

### Continued development

In the future I plan on working more on my JavaScript so I can more readily create functionality on my sites.
